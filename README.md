# Basic Shapes Game

This is an educational game that helps children (4+) learning about some basic math shapes (circle, square, triangle). It is known that the kids learn the best while playing and the idea behind this project is that this game would enhance some of their math skills, recognizing shapes. After the shapes are already introduced to children, this game would help them review their knowledge of how does the circle, square and triangle look like. 

I have decided to create this game since my background is in education and I have worked mainly with students with additional needs. I would love to be in the tech-education industry and work on parts of online learning, specificaly on making the learning content accesible to all by intergating assisitive technology inside the learning platforms.

My original idea was to have a child choose a shape that he/she would collect while playing the game and avoid other two. Since this is my frist project, I needed to simplify it a bit. The instructions are given before the game is started. So the only shape that has to be collected is a circle which will, by colliding with the circle, increase a score of the player and the game will be over if the player collides with a square and triangle. 

The player is moved by using the keyboard arrows and it can go left, right, up and down. The shapes are coming from the left toward the player. 

One of the weakness of the game is that some shapes are overlapping which unable the player to collect some circles since they are covered with squares and triangles.
