# Basic Shapes Game

This is an educational game that helps children (5+) learn about some basic math shapes (circle, square, triangle). It is known that kids learn the best while playing and the idea behind this project is that this game would enhance some of their math skills, recognizing basic shapes. After the shapes are already introduced to children, this game would help them review their knowledge of what circles, squares, and triangles look like. I used donuts instead of circles, pillows instead of squares and road signs are triangles. In this way, children will be triggered to look for shapes around them that look like the shapes presented in the game.  

I have decided to create this game since my background is in education and I have worked mainly with students with additional needs. I would love to be in the tech-education industry and work on parts of online learning or e-learning, specifically on making the learning content accessible to all by integrating assistive technology inside the learning platforms.  

How to play the game:
The instructions are given on the left side of the screen. A player needs to collect circles and if he/she/they collides with circles, it will increase the score by one. The game will be over if the player collides with a square and a triangle.
The player moves by using the keyboard arrows and it can go left, right, up, and down. The shapes are coming from the left toward the player. 

The orange-blue pattern is a common colorblind-friendly pattern. There is a button, that can be clicked under the instructions, which is actually a text-to-speech feature. This allows children who are still learning how to read or have reading difficulties to be independent while playing the game.  

Some ideas for improvement:
What was described above could be Level 1 of the game. When the player collects 10 circles(donuts), will be moved to Level 2. 
Level 2- Squares should be collected but more objects that look like circles, squares, triangles will be added. When the player collects 20 squares. will be moved to Level 3.
Level 3- Triangles are the target. Again, new shapes are added. When the player collects 30 triangles will be the end of the game. 

Also, I should work on responsive web design so the game could be played on different devices.
