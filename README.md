# Project_1
 I have decided to create an educational game which will be about some basic math concepts- shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle). I have two ideas on mind, and I will try with one of them to experiment. The idea is that a student will be on a way to school. The road will be inside the canva. The teacher will be giving instructiuons to the student by having instructions written in a cloud such as: Collect as many squares as you can and avoid all other shapes. the shapes will be falling down the road and the student will be controlled by arrows (keyboard). 
 
 
 I tried to find a background (an image for the road and then I got an idea to have an animated road that is going down the y axis. So I have been researching about the ways that will ake that happen. 
 
 
 the road is moving but not in a way I want :-). Now I also want to have a GIF of a boy walking up the road so I am finding ways to eliminate the gif backgrounds so I can use it in the game. Maybe I am also complicating it too much.
